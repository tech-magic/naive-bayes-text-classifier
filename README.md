# Naive Bayes Text Classification

Here is a java implementation for Naive Bayes text classification algorithm. A typical example is an implementation of a spam identification filter for emails.

The algorithm is based on the following concepts.

1. Entropy
2. Bayes Theorem in Probability

# Prerequisites

Java 5 or higher

# Running the Project

1. Go to implementation folder. Type `javac *.java`
2. Now type `java NaiveBayesTextClassifierUI`
3. Browse the file contents inside `input-data` directory to train the system. (if you're not sure on which folder to browse have a look at `trainKnowldgeBase()` method in the `TrainingModule` class)
4. Once you've done training you will see a `words.db` file saved with training data.
5. Then provide a sample text and classify the category of the whole text for yourself.
6. Enjoy the program.
